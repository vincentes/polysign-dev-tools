# Polysign Development Tools
Developing on the ICP blockchain can be difficult. This extension improves the DevExp.

## Features

- Automatic generation of candid files (done)
- Stop / restart dfx (coming soon)
- Run bat tests (maybe)

## Requirements
- Rust extensions for cargo compilation

Note: If you do not have a Rust extension for automatic cargo checking the project, then **this extension will fail to generate candid files**.

## Known Issues
None yet. Extension is basic for now.

## Release Notes

Users appreciate release notes as you update your extension.

### 0.0.1
Added automatic candid generation when saving Rust files.

### 0.0.2
Incorporated the Polysign logo.
